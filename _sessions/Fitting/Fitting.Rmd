# Where we are at

- Have a business question
    - How can I predict heart attacks?

- Have data relevant to that question
    - Records from 300 patients

- Data is cleaned and in a dataframe
    - `heartdisease.txt`

## What's next?

<high>Select</high> and <high>train</high> model(s)

# Why do we need a model at all?


### Theoretical

*To <high>learn something</high> from the data*

- Which features are most <high>important</high>?
- What are the <high>relationship</high> between features and criterion?
- How can I make <high>predictions</high> from new data?

### Practical

- Need a computational representation of the data that can be programmed

# What models are there?

There are *thousands* of machine learning models

No one could possibly know them all.

In this course, you will learn 3 of the most popular:


|Model|Description |
|:----|:---- |
|Regression|A weighted linear combination of features and weights|
|Decision Tree|A series of heirarchical 'yes/no' decisions|
|Random Forests|Combination of many decision trees|
