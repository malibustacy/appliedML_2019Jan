### Overview

In this practical, you will enter two model competitions, one on regression and one on classification, to demonstrate your knowledge of:

1. Machine learning models
2. Fitting and prediction
3. Cross-validation and optimization
4. Data preprocessing and feature selection

...and be like Tom Cruise!


### Datasets

|[nonviolent_crime](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/appliedML_2019Jan/master/1_Data/nonviolent_crime.csv)| 1000 | 102|


```{r, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# Load datasets locally
library(tidyverse)
pima_diabetes <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/appliedML_2019Jan/master/1_Data/pima_diabetes.csv")

nonviolent_crime <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/appliedML_2019Jan/master/1_Data/nonviolent_crime.csv")
```

- The `murders_crime` and `violent_crime` data are subsets of the Communities and Crime Unnormalized Data Set data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Mission statement

The members of governing council of Basel-Stadt recently met at the comfortable, yet luxurious home of Elisabeth Ackerman's, the council's president, to watch the latest science-fiction blockbuster, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report">Minority report</a>. In this bright, utopian movie Chief John Anderton, marvelously played by Tom Cruise, works together with friendly, but slightly introverted super-beings with the rare (but scientifically proven - see rigorous academic [paper](2011-01894-001.pdf)) ability to see into the future to arrest perpetrators not after they committed a crime (boring!) but before. Aside from spending a wonderful evening with his colleagues, Baschi D端rr, head of justice and homeland security department and the one who proposed the movie, was hoping to win over his fellow council members for a revolutionary program to tackle an unprecedented swell in non-violent crimes and murders in Basel-Stadt in recent months. Baschi D端rr knew, of course, that precogs - this is how the super-beings were called - belonged to the land of fairy tails, but during his visit to the recent useR! conference in Brisbane he had learned of the next best thing: machine learning. His goal was, thus, to hire an elite team of programmers and to equip them with a maximally informative data set of past crimes to predict where future crimes would occur. Knowing that Basel is just like the United States, Baschi D端rr had already spent a significant amount of money to acquire a data set of murders and non-violent crimes across American counties. Now, he only needed to convince his colleagues. And Fortuna was on his side. The movie and the few bottles of Napoleon French Brandy that he had bought at Coop earlier that day impressed so much that Elisabeth Ackerman decided to dissolve the investigative branch of the police and invest all of its budget into the new ML task force. The next morning, with a slight, but manageable hangover, Baschi D端rr announced an international ML modeling competition promising that whoever built the best model would head the new task force and be rewarded in addition with a lot of &#127851;&#127851;&#127851;.

## A - Preliminaries

1. Open your `BaselRBootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. Make sure that the data file(s) listed in the `Datasets` section above are in your `1_Data` folder.

2. Open a new R script. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Save it as a new file called `Models_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

3. Using `library()` load the set of packages for this practical listed in the packages section above.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
## NAME
## DATE
## Prediction Practical

library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

4. With the code below load each of the data sets listed in the `Datasets` as new objects.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# REGRESSION: (Non-) violent crime statistics
nonviolent_crime <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/nonviolent_crime.csv")

# CLASSIFICATION: Murders crime statistics
murders_crime <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/murders_crime.csv")
```

## B Competition rules

1. You may enter either one or both of two competitions, one on regression (`nonviolent_crime`) and on classification (`murders_crime`), for the price of &#127851;&#127851;&#127851;.

2. To enter the competitions, you must submit for each competition no more, no less than one caret `train`-object containing your candidate model. To submit the model, first save your model as an `.RDS`-file named `yourname_regression.RDS` and `your_name_classification.RDS`, respectively, with `yourname` replaced by your name or pseudonym using the code below.

```{r}
# save trian obect as .RDS
saveRDS('1_Data/your_name_train.RDS')

```

3. Submit your `.RDS` file (containing your training object) via these following Links sheets:

<div align = "center">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Task type</th>
<th>Criterion</th>
<th>Performance measure</th>
<th>Submission link</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Regression</td> 
  <td>non-violent crimes (`nonViolPerPop`)</td>
  <td>Accuracy</td>
  <td>[**Submit candidate**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevxp_hxSUrAYgiSU-Xv3hRw_get43qk15blw7QEeLHlbrNbA/viewform?usp=sf_link)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Classification</td> 
  <td>murders (`muders`)</td>
  <td>MAE</td>
  <td>[**Submit candidate**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciw9WyTttmG9Oq93xjGKw_kxNJY9YmtLQvf_p35BcFNm1G-A/viewform?usp=sf_link)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

4. You may work alone or team up with fellow participants. We recommend the latter, but working alone may, of course, mean more &#127851;&#127851;&#127851;.  

5. Use any trick in your bag (or `caret`'s bag). Feel free to try different models, use different tuning parameter settings, select any variables or variable selection methods that you deem useful.

6. You may even consider creating new variables. The code below shows you how to create new variables for either data set. Note, the created variables are not created based on any knowledge of the data - pure random selection. So if you want to come up with new variables, create your own. 

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
# (Non-) violent crime statistics
nonviolent_crime <- nonviolent_crime %>% 
  mutate(
    pctUrbanXindianPerCap2 = pctUrban * indianPerCap ** 2,
    FemalePctDiv^PctFam2Par = FemalePctDiv ** PctFam2Par)

# Murders crime statistics
murders_crime <- murders_crime %>% 
  mutate(
    AsianPerCapXHousVacant2 = AsianPerCap * HousVacant ** 2,
    population%blackPerCap = population / blackPerCap)
```
