### Overview

Demonstrate your machine-learning, jedi-knight skills in this second model competition. Predict gender from a tweeter's meta information and win lots of &#127851;&#127851;&#127851; and a hard copy of Kuhn's [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9781461468486)


### Datasets

# Mission statement

After the machine learning task force maneuvered itself into obsolescence having developed the perfect algorithm to predict the locations of future crime, Baschi Dürr, head of justice and homeland security department of Basel-Stadt, needed another application for his task. He feared that Elisabeth Ackerman, president of the governing council, might otherwise withdraw his newly-earned funding. And he knew he had to act quickly. To finance a new set of Wegner Swivel Chairs ([boy, they are great!](https://twentytwentyone.com/product/pp-502-swivel-chair-pp-mobler)) for city hall's conference rooms, Elisabeth Ackerman and Dr. Eva Herzog, head of the city's financial department, had just announced that any expendable resources would to be invested into cryptocurrencies. In search of inspiration, Baschi Dürr called up his American friends, who had previously given him such a great price on the American crime  data set. He learned that they had recently begun to use machine learning for political education with outstanding results ([truly outstanding!](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/06/cambridge-analytica-how-turn-clicks-into-votes-christopher-wylie)). They explained to him that, using machine learning, one could uncover a person's gender or personality to then send that person tailored political information. Knowing the information hungry Swiss democracy, Baschi Dürr wasted no time after he ended his call to congregate his machine learning task force: Switzerland was not going to miss out on this amazing opportunity. America first, [Switzerland second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reuJ8yVCgSM).

## A - Preliminaries

1. Open your `BaselRBootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. 

2. Open a new R script. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Save it as a new file called `Models_competition_2.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

3. Using `library()` load the set of packages for this practical listed in the packages section above.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
## NAME
## DATE
## Modeling competition

library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

4. With the code below, load the `tweets` data set and change any character variables to factors.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Load tweet data
tweets <- read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/appliedML_2019Jan/master/1_Data/tweets_train.csv")

# change character to factor
tweets <- tweets %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)

```

## B Competition rules

1. The goal of the competition is to predict with maximal `Accuracy` whether a twitter user is `'female'` or `'male'`.

2. Entering the competition grants you a chance to win lots of &#127851;&#127851;&#127851; and a hard copy of Kuhn's [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9781461468486).

3. To enter the competition, you must submit no more, no less than one caret `train`-object containing your candidate model. To submit the model, first save your model as an `.RDS`-file named `yourname_pseudonym_train.RDS`, with `yourname` replaced by your real name and `pseudonym` replaced by a pseudonym of your choice. See the code below.

```{r}
# save train obect as .RDS
saveRDS(my_train,'1_Data/myname_mypseudonym_train.RDS')
```

4. Submit your `.RDS` file (containing your training object) via the following Links sheets:

<div align = "center">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Task type</th>
<th>Criterion</th>
<th>Performance measure</th>
<th>Submission link</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Classification</td> 
  <td>tweets (`gender`)</td>
  <td>Accuracy</td>
  <td>[**Submit candidate**](https://www.dropbox.com/request/vDp6ooS5BdzwBpFtdWJQ)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

4. Use any weapon in your arsenal (or `caret`'s arsenal). Feel free to try different models, use different tuning parameter settings or preprocessing methods, make use of all or some variables. Whatever may lead to the highest prediction `Accuracy`.

5. In order to be able to evaluate the models refrain from any manipulation (or engineering) of feature other than those accessible via the `preProcess` argument in the `train()` function.
