# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a <high>field of artificial intelligence</high> that uses <high>statistical techniques</high> to give computer systems the ability to <high>"learn"</high> (e.g., progressively improve <high>performance</high> on a specific task) <high>from data</high>, without being explicitly programmed.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

## What does this mean?

- To do machine learning, you need (clean, relevant) data!

- Machine Learning is about making *data driven* decisions.

- ML algorithms try to automatically figure out which information is important and which is not.

- ML algorithms are always guided by a *formal definition of performance*.

# Examples

### Predicting Heart Attacks

You are a hospital administrator. 

Patients often come to the emergency room complaining of chest pain. Some are having heart attacks, many are not.

*How do you know which patients are actually having heart attacks and which are not?*

### Predicting customer purchasing

You are an analyst at a marketing company.

You can pay $0.05 to place a targeted ad for a in front of a potential customer.

*How do you know which customers are likely to click the ad and which are not?*

# Solution 1: Intuition

.pull-left6[

Many people decide based an individual, or group's personal, intuitive judgment.

- "I have a feeling this patient is having a heart attack"
- "I know we should target millenials with ads, trust me on this"

# Solution 1: Intuition

.pull-left6[

## What are potential problems with intuition?

- Might not tell you anything about *why* it makes a prediction.

- Could be based on reasons other than accuracy (e.g.; self protection)

- Without rigorous testing, impossible to know if <high>critical information is being ignored</high>.

- If the decision isn't programmed, it might be <high>impossible to replicate</high> (and improve) in the future.

- When objectively wrong, intuition can always be defended 'in hindsight'.

# Solution 2: Data-Driven Machine Learning

.pull-left6[

Here's how a data-driven, ML approach would look:


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("image/heartdisease_data_ss.jpg")
```


- Based on historical <high>data</high> from past patients at this hospital...
- A <high>regression model</high> ...
- Using the patient's <high>age, cholesterol level, and ecg</high>...
- <high>Predicts</high> the probability that this patient is having a heart attack is only <high>20%</high>.

# Solution 2: Data-Driven Machine Learning

.pull-left6[

### What are the benefits of ML?

- Algorithms fit to your past data can tell you which variables are important an which are not.

- Make explicit, quantitative predictions of variables of interest.

- Many can give you probability estimates, and estimated errors, rather than single decisions or point estimates.

- Can reveal novel insights about your data!

- Can be programmed and automated.

# What types of machine learning tasks are there?

There are many types of machine learning tasks, each of which call for different models

Three general categories

|:----|:-----|
|Unsupervised|Customer segmentation|
|Supervised|Classification, regression|
|Reinforcement Learning|[Robot navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_gxLKSsSIE) |

In this course, we focus on <high>Supervised</high> tasks

# Why do we need a model at all?

### Theoretical

*To <high>learn something</high> from the data*

- Learn which features are most <high>important</high> in predicting the criterion
- Understand the <high>relationship</high> between features and criterion.
    - Strong? Weak? Postive? Negative?
- Make <high>predictions</high> for new data.
    - I've got a new patient, how likely is it that (s)he is having a heart attack?

### Practical

- Need a computational / mathematical representation of the data that can be programmed and automated.
