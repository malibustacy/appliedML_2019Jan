# What is Machine Learning?

>Machine learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) from data, without being explicitly programmed.
>~ Wikipedia

## What else?

- Machine Learning is about making *data driven* decisions.

- To do machine learning, you need data!

- ML algorithms try to automatically figure out which information is important and which is not

- Performance of an ML algorithm can always be defined by some accuracy or loss function.

# Examples

### Predicting Heart Attacks

You are a hospital administrator. 

Patients often come to the emergency room complaining of chest pain. Some are having heart attacks, many are not.

*How do you know which patients are actually having heart attacks and which are not?*

### Predicting customer purchasing

You are an analyst at a marketing company.

You can pay $0.05 to place a targeted ad for a in front of a potential customer.

*How do you know which customers are likely to click the ad and which are not?*

# Solution 1: Intuition

.pull-left6[

Many people  decide based an individual, or group's personal, intuitive judgment.

- "I have a feeling this patient is having a heart attack"
- "Put the ad in front of anyone who has made a purchase in the past 2 months. That's what they do in other industries"

### What are potential problems with this?

- "Put the ad in front of anyone who has made a purchase in the past 2 months. That's what they do in other industries"

### What are potential problems with this?

- Without rigorous testing, impossible to know if <high>critical information is being ignored</high>.

- If the decision isn't programmed, it might be <high>impossible to replicate</high> (and improve) in the future.

- Intuition could be based on <high>biased processes</high>

# Solution 2: Data-Driven Machine Learning

.pull-left6[

With machine learning, you can create an algorithm <high>optimised</high> to solve your task

- Based on <high>data from past patients at this hospital</high>, a <high>regression</high> model using the patient's <high>age, BMI, and health history</high>, predicts the probability that this patient is having a heart attack is only <high>20% </high>.

- Based on <high>prior purchasing records</high>, a <high>decision tree</high> predicts that a <high>male, 20 year old Facebook user with at least 500 'friends'</high> has a <high>80% chance</high> of clicking the ad.

### What are the benefits of ML?

- Algorithms fit to your past data can tell you which variables are important an which are not.

- Many can give you probability estimates, rather than single decisions.
