# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a <high>field of artificial intelligence</high> that uses <high>statistical techniques</high> to give computer systems the ability to <high>"learn"</high> (e.g., progressively improve <high>performance</high> on a specific task) <high>from data</high>, without being explicitly programmed.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

## What does this mean?

- Machine Learning is about making *data driven* decisions.

- To do machine learning, you need (clean, relevant) data!

- ML algorithms try to automatically figure out which information is important and which is not.

- ML algorithms are always guided by a *formal definition of performance*.

# Examples

### Predicting Heart Attacks

You are an intake nurse at an emergency room.

A patient comes in complaining of chest pain and thinks they are having a heart attack

*How do you decide whether or not the patient is really having a heart attack?*

### Predicting sales

You are an analyst at a retail corporation.

The executive team is considering whether or not to open a new retail location in Basel.

*How can you predict what the sales of the new store would be?*

# Solution 1: Intuition

.pull-left6[

Many decisions are based on an individual's intuitive 'gut' judgment.

> "I have a feeling this patient is having a heart attack" <br>

> "Sales will be at least 100,000 CHF per month, trust me on this."

# Solution 1: Intuition

.pull-left6[

### What are potential problems with intuition?

- Might not tell you anything about *why* it makes a prediction.

- Could be based on reasons other than accuracy (e.g.; self protection)

- Without rigorous testing, impossible to know if <high>critical information is being ignored</high>.

- If the decision isn't programmed, it might be <high>impossible to replicate</high> (and improve) in the future.

- Intuition is rarely consistently tracked and evaluated. When wrong, intuition can always be defended 'in hindsight' (ML too!).

Here's how a data-driven, ML approach would look:


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("image/heartdisease_data_ss.jpg")
```


Based on <high>historical data</high> from past patients <high>at this hospital</high>, a <high>regression model</high>, using the patient's <high>age, cholesterol level, and ecg</high>, <high>predicts</high> the probability that this patient is having a heart attack is only <high>20%</high>.

# Solution 2: Data-Driven Machine Learning

.pull-left6[

### What are the benefits of ML?

- Algorithms fit to your past data can tell you which variables are important and which are not.

- Make explicit, quantitative predictions of variables of interest.

- Many can give you probability estimates, and estimated errors, rather than single decisions or point estimates.

- Can reveal novel insights about your data!

- Can be programmed and automated.
