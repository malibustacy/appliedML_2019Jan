                       select(-cyl, -displ, -year),
                     method = "glm",
                     trControl = train_control)

# Tasks

## A - Setup

1. Open your `BaselRBootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. Make sure that the data file(s) listed in the `Datasets` section above are in your `1_Data` folder.

2. Open a new R script. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Save it as a new file called `Features_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

3. Using `library()` load the set of packages for this practical listed in the packages section above.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
## NAME
## DATE
## Prediction Practical

library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

4. In the code below, we will load each of the datasets listed in the `Datasets` as new objects

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# College data
college_train <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/college_train.csv")
college_test <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/college_train.csv")

# House data
house_train <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/house_train.csv")
house_train <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/house_test.csv")
```

5. Take a look at the first few rows of each dataframe by printing then to the console.

6. Print the numbers of rows and columns of each dataset using the `dim()` function

7. Look at the names of the dataframe with the `names()` function.

8. Open the dataset in a new window using `View()`. Do they look ok?

9. We need to do a little bit of data cleaning before starting. Specifically, we need to convert all columns to factors: Do this by running the following code:

```{r}
# Convert all character columns to factor

college_train <- college_train %>%
          mutate_if(is.character, factor)

college_test <- college_test %>%
          mutate_if(is.character, factor)

house_train <- house_train %>%
          mutate_if(is.character, factor)

house_test <- house_test %>%
          mutate_if(is.character, factor)
```

# College Graduation Rates

In this section, we will again predict college graduation rates `Grad_Rate` from the `college_train` and `college_test` datasets. Here's how the first few rows of `college_train` should look:

```{r, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::kable(college_train[1:10,])
```

## Fitting

Using the basics steps in the Examples section above, fit each of three models, regression, decision trees, and random forests to the `college_train` data. your goal is to fit models predicting `Grad.Rate`

1. Look at the `college_train` dataset and decide which features you think are reasonable to include in a model.

2. Using `trainControl()`, set your training control method to `"none"`. Save your object as `ctrl_none`

3. Using `train()` fit a regression model called `grad_glm` predicting `Grad.Rate`, and using the features you think are reasonable.

4. Explore your `grad_glm` object by looking at `grad_glm$finalModel` and using `summary()`, what do you find?

5. Using `train()`, fit a decision tree model called `grad_dt` predicting `Grad.Rate` (using the same features as above).

- Set the complexity parameter to `cp = 0.01`

```{r}
grad_dt <- train(form = Grad.Rate ~ .,    # Make sure to specify your features here!
                 data = data_train,
                 method = "rpart",
                 trControl = train_control,
                 tuneGrid = expand.grid(cp = .01))   # Set complexity parameter
```


6. Explore your `grad_dt` object by looking at `grad_dt$finalModel` and plotting it with `plot(as.party(grad_dt$finalModel))`, what do you find?

7. Using `train()`, fit a random forest model called `grad_rf` predicting `Grad.Rate` (using the same features as above).

- Set the number of randomly sampled parameter to `mtry` = 2

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
grad_rf <- train(form = Grad.Rate ~ .,    # Make sure to specify your features here!
                 data = college_train,
                 method = "rf",
                 trControl = train_control,
                 tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2))  # Set number of features randomly selected
```

8. Using `postResample()`, determine the fitting performance of each of your models.

9. Which one had the best fits? What was the fitting MAE of each model?

10. If you'd like to, try visualizing the fitting results using the plotting code shown in the Examples tab above.

##  Prediction

1. Using `postResample()`, determine the *prediction* performance of each of your models on the `college_test` data.

2. How does each model's prediction performance compare to its fitting performance? Is it worse? Better? The same?

3. Which of the three models has the best prediction performance?

4. If you had to use one of these three models in the real-world, which one would it be? Why?

5. If someone came to you and asked "If I use your model in the future to predict the graduation rate of a new college, how accurate do you think it would be?", what would you say?

# House Prices in King County, Washington

In this section, we will predict the prices of houses in King County Washington (home of Seattle, [which you can thank for this](https://qz.com/208457/a-cartographic-guide-to-starbucks-global-domination/)) using the `house_train` and `house_test` datasets. Here's how they should look:

```{r, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::kable(house_train[1:10,])
```

## Fitting

Your goal in the following models is to predict `price`

1. Look at the `house_train` dataset and decide which features you think are reasonable to include in a model.

2. Using `trainControl()`, set your training control method to `"none"`. Save your object as `ctrl_none`

3. Using `train()` fit a regression model called `price_glm` predicting `price` using the features you think are reasonable.

4. Explore your `price_glm` object by looking at `price_glm$finalModel` and using `summary()`, what do you find?

5. Using `train()`, fit a decision tree model called `price_dt` predicting `price` and using the same features as above.

- Set the complexity parameter to `cp = 0.01`

6. Explore your `price_dt` object by looking at `price_dt$finalModel` and plotting it with `plot(as.party(price_dt$finalModel))`, what do you find?

7. Using `train()`, fit a random forest model called `price_rf` predicting `price` and using the same features as above.

- Set the number of randomly sampled parameter to `mtry` = 2

8. Using `postResample()`, determine the fitting performance of each of your models

9. Which one had the best fits? What was the fitting MAE of each model?

10. If you'd like to, try visualizing the fitting results using the plotting code in the Examples

##  Prediction

1. Using `postResample()`, determine the prediction performance of each of your models on the `house_test` data.

2. How does each model's prediction performance compare to its fitting performance? Is it worse? Better? The same?

3. Which of the three models has the best prediction performance?

4. If you had to use one of these three models in the real-world, which one would it be? Why?

5. If someone came to you and asked "If I use your model in the future to predict house selling prices, how accurate do you think it would be?", what would you say?

# Exploring model tuning parameters

1. In all of your decision tree models so far, you have been setting the complexity parameter to 0.01. Try setting it to a largre value of 0.2 and see how your decision trees change (by plotting them). Do they get more or less complicated? How does increasing this value affect fitting and prediction performance? If you are interested in learning more about this parameter, look at the help menu with `?rpart.control`.

2. In each of your random forest models, you have been setting the `mtry` argument to 2. Try setting it to a larger value such as 5 and re-running your models. How does increasing this value affect fitting and prediction performance? If you are interested in learning more about this parameter, look at the help menu with `?randomForest`.

3. By default, the `train()` function uses 500 trees in `method = "rf"`. How do the number of trees affect performance? To answer this, try setting the number of trees to 1,000 (see example below) and re-evaluating your model's training and test performance. What do you find? What if you set the number of trees to just 10?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create random forest model with 1000 trees

mod <- train(form = hwy ~ year + cyl + displ,
             data = data_train,
             method = "rf",
             trControl = train_control,
             ntree = 1000,   # use 1000 trees! (Instead of the default value of 500)
             tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2))

```

# Challenges

1. So far you've probably been using most, if not all, available features in predicting house sales. But imagine someone came to you and said "I need to know how much a set of new houses will sell for, but I only have access to three features `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, and `sqft_living`. Which of your models should I use and how accurate will they be? How would you answer that question? Use your modelling techniques to find out!

2. Repeat your modelling process, but now do a classification task. Specifically, predict whether or not a house sells for at least \$1,000,000. To do this, you'll first need to create a new column called `million` in both your `house_train` and `house_test` datasets (the code below should help you). Then, use your best modelling techniques to make this prediction. How accurate are your models in predicting whether or not a house will sell for over $1,000,000? Don't forget to use the `confusionMatrix()` function instead of `postResample()` to evaluate your model's accuracy!

```{r}
# Add million column to house_train and house_test
#  A factor indicating whether or not a house sells for
#   over 1,000,0000

house_train <- house_train %>%
  mutate(million = factor(price > 1000000))

house_test <- house_test %>%
  mutate(million = factor(price > 1000000))
```
