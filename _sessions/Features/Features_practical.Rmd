# Tasks

## A - Setup

1. Open your `BaselRBootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. Make sure that the data file(s) listed in the `Datasets` section above are in your `1_Data` folder.

2. Open a new R script. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Save it as a new file called `Features_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

3. Using `library()` load the set of packages for this practical listed in the packages section above.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
## NAME
## DATE
## Prediction Practical

library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

4. In the code below, we will load each of the datasets listed in the `Datasets` as new objects.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Pimo Indians diabetes
pima_diabetes <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/pima_diabetes.csv")

# (Non-) violent crime statistics
violent_crime    <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/violent_crime.csv")
nonviolent_crime <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/nonviolent_crime.csv")
```


## B - Pima Indians Diabetes

In this section, you will explore feature selection for the Pima Indians Diabetes data set. The Pima are a group of Native Americans living in Arizona. A genetic predisposition allowed this group to survive normally to a diet poor of carbohydrates for years. In the recent years, because of a sudden shift from traditional agricultural crops to processed foods, together with a decline in physical activity, made them develop the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes and for this reason they have been subject of many studies. 

1. Take a look at the first few rows of the pima diabetes data frame by printing then to the console.

2. Print the numbers of rows and columns of each dataset using the `dim()` function.

3. Look at the names of the dataframe with the `names()` function.

4. Open the dataset in a new window using `View()`. Do they look ok?

### Splitting

5. As always, before you do anything you need to make sure that you separate a hold-out data set for later. Create `pima_train` and `pima_test` using `createDataPartition()` with as little as <b>15% of cases going into the training set</b>. Also store the variable `diabetes` in the test set, which will be the criterion . 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# split index
train_index <- createDataPartition(XX$XX, p = .15, list = FALSE)

# train and test sets
pima_train <- XX %>% slice(train_index)
pima_test  <- XX %>% slice(-train_index)

# test criterion
criterion <- pima_test$XX
```

```{r}
# split index
train_index <- createDataPartition(pima_diabetes$diabetes, p = .15, list = FALSE)

# train and test sets
pima_train <- pima_diabetes %>% slice(train_index)
pima_test  <- pima_diabetes %>% slice(-train_index)

# test criterion
criterion <- pima_test$diabetes
```

### Remove unwanted features

Ok, with the training set, let's get to work and remove some features.

6. First split the training data into a data frame holding the predictors and the criterion using the code below.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Select predictors
pima_train_pred <- pima_train %>% select(-diabetes)

# Select criterion
pima_train_crit <- pima_train %>% select(diabetes) %>% pull()
```

7. Although, this dataset is rather small and rather well curated, test if there are any excessively correlated features using `cor()` and `findCorrelation()` using the code below. Are there any?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# determine correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(XX_pred)

# find excessively correlated variables
findCorrelation(corr_matrix)
```

```{r}
# determine correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(pima_train_pred)

# find excessively correlated variables
findCorrelation(corr_matrix)
```

8. Now, test if there are any near-zero variance predictors. Any of those?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# find near zero variance predictors
nearZeroVar(XX_pred)
```

```{r}
# find near zero variance predictors
nearZeroVar(pima_train_pred)
```

## Feature importance

After having retained all features in the previous section section, this section explores feature selection on grounds of feature importance. To do this, we first need to fit our model. How about a simple logistic gression aka `method = 'glm'`? 

9. Fit the `glm` to the training data.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# fit random forest
pima_glm <- train(diabetes ~ .,
                data = XX,
                method = XX
                )
```

```{r}
# fit random forest
pima_glm <- train(diabetes ~ .,
                data = pima_train,
                method = 'glm')
```

10. Evaluate feature importance using `varImp()`. The function will show importance on a scale from 0 (least important feature) to 100 (most important feature). You can set `scale = TRUE` to see absolute importance measures in t-values.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# determine variable importance
varimp_glm <- varImp(XX)

# print variable importance
varimp_glm

# print variable importance
plot(varimp_glm)
```

```{r}
# determine variable importance
varimp_glm <- varImp(pima_glm)

# print variable importance
varimp_glm

# print variable importance
plot(varimp_glm)
```

11. Now, fit the glm a second time using only the four best features and store the result in a different fit object.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# fit glm with best four features
pima_glm4 = train(diabetes ~ XX + YY + ZZ + AA,
                data = XX,
                method = XX)
```

```{r}
# fit glm with best four features
pima_glm4 = train(diabetes ~ glucose + mass + pregnant + pedigree,
                data = pima_train,
                method = 'glm')
```

12. Using both fits, all features versus the best four, predict the criterion and evaluate the prediction using `confusionMatrix()`. Which model `glm is better?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# determine predictions for test data
pima_glm_pred <- predict(XX, newdata = XX)
pima_glm4_pred <- predict(XX, newdata = XX)

# evaluate the results
confusionMatrix(XX, reference = XX)
confusionMatrix(XX, reference = XX)
```

```{r}
# determine predictions for test data
pima_glm_pred <- predict(pima_glm, newdata = pima_test)
pima_glm4_pred <- predict(pima_glm4, newdata = pima_test)

# evaluate the results
confusionMatrix(pima_glm_pred, criterion)
confusionMatrix(pima_glm4_pred, criterion)
```

13. You probbaly have observed that the model with two features less is actually slightly better than the full model. Why do you think is that the case?

14. Play around: Up the proportion dedicated to training or use a different model, e.g., `random forest`, and see whether things change. 

## C - Murders

In this section, you will explore feature selection but with a data set with very different properties. The data combines socio-economic data from the '90 Census, data from Law Enforcement Management and Admin Stats survey, and crime data from the FBI, allowing to analyse the relationship between various socio-demographic variables and whether murders have been committed (`murders`), the criterion of this exercise.     

1. Take a look at the first few rows of the `murders_crime` data frame by printing then to the console.

2. Print the numbers of rows and columns of each dataset using the `dim()` function.

3. Look at the names of the dataframe with the `names()` function.

4. Open the dataset in a new window using `View()`. Do they look ok?

### Splitting

5. Again, before you do anything you need to make sure that you separate a hold-out data set for later. Create `murders_train` and `murders_test` using `createDataPartition()` with again as little as <b>15% of cases going into the training set</b>. Also store the variable `diabetes` in the test set, which will be the criterion . 

```{r}
# split index
train_index <- createDataPartition(murders_crime$murders, p = .15, list = FALSE)

# train and test sets
murders_train <- murders_crime %>% slice(train_index)
murders_test  <- murders_crime %>% slice(-train_index)

# test criterion
criterion <- pima_test$diabetes
```

### Remove unwanted features

Ok, with the training set, let's get to work and remove some features.

6. First split the training data into a data frame holding the predictors and the criterion using the code below.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Select predictors
pima_train_pred <- pima_train %>% select(-diabetes)

# Select criterion
pima_train_crit <- pima_train %>% select(diabetes) %>% pull()
```

7. Although, this dataset is rather small and rather well curated, test if there are any excessively correlated features using `cor()` and `findCorrelation()` using the code below. Are there any?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# determine correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(XX_pred)

# find excessively correlated variables
findCorrelation(corr_matrix)
```

```{r}
# determine correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(pima_train_pred)

# find excessively correlated variables
findCorrelation(corr_matrix)
```

8. Now, test if there are any near-zero variance predictors. Any of those?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# find near zero variance predictors
nearZeroVar(XX_pred)
```

```{r}
# find near zero variance predictors
nearZeroVar(pima_train_pred)
```

## Feature importance

After having retained all features in the previous section section, this section explores feature selection on grounds of feature importance. To do this, we first need to fit our model. How about a simple logistic gression aka `method = 'glm'`? 

9. Fit the `glm` to the training data.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# fit random forest
pima_glm <- train(diabetes ~ .,
                data = XX,
                method = XX
                )
```

```{r}
# fit random forest
pima_glm <- train(diabetes ~ .,
                data = pima_train,
                method = 'glm')
```

10. Evaluate feature importance using `varImp()`. The function will show importance on a scale from 0 (least important feature) to 100 (most important feature). You can set `scale = TRUE` to see absolute importance measures in t-values.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# determine variable importance
varimp_glm <- varImp(XX)

# print variable importance
varimp_glm

# print variable importance
plot(varimp_glm)
```

```{r}
# determine variable importance
varimp_glm <- varImp(pima_glm)

# print variable importance
varimp_glm

# print variable importance
plot(varimp_glm)
```

11. Now, fit the glm a second time using only the four best features and store the result in a different fit object.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# fit glm with best four features
pima_glm4 = train(diabetes ~ XX + YY + ZZ + AA,
                data = XX,
                method = XX)
```

```{r}
# fit glm with best four features
pima_glm4 = train(diabetes ~ glucose + mass + pregnant + pedigree,
                data = pima_train,
                method = 'glm')
```

12. Using both fits, all features versus the best four, predict the criterion and evaluate the prediction using `confusionMatrix()`. Which model `glm is better?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# determine predictions for test data
pima_glm_pred <- predict(XX, newdata = XX)
pima_glm4_pred <- predict(XX, newdata = XX)

# evaluate the results
confusionMatrix(XX, reference = XX)
confusionMatrix(XX, reference = XX)
```

```{r}
# determine predictions for test data
pima_glm_pred <- predict(pima_glm, newdata = pima_test)
pima_glm4_pred <- predict(pima_glm4, newdata = pima_test)

# evaluate the results
confusionMatrix(pima_glm_pred, criterion)
confusionMatrix(pima_glm4_pred, criterion)
```

13. You probbaly have observed that the model with two features less is actually slightly better than the full model. Why do you think is that the case?

14. Play around: Up the proportion dedicated to training or use a different model, e.g., `random forest`, and see whether things change.
